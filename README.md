## gboilerplate
I built this command so I don't have to write code I don't want to write.

See [this repo](https://github.com/gfriesen98/react-router-boilerplate) for more information.

Usage:

`npx gfriesen98/gboilerplate name [folderName]`

You can add an alias to this or follow the steps below.


1. Clone this repo
2. cd gboilerplate
3. `npm link`

Should be able to run `gboilerplate [help] [name folderName]` globally.
